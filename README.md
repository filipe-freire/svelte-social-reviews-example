# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### What is in this repo?

This repository holds my solution for the [Frontend Mentors Social Proof Section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). I decided to solve this one again (had [previously solved it](https://github.com/filipe-freire/social-proof-section-master) using only HTML & CSS) using Svelte + Typescript with ViteJS to both practice my skills with those tools and to see how well I could refactor my previous solution.

### Key Takeaways

Having developed the majority of my projects using React this past year, here are my thoughts:

- The development experience was impressive, especially with the combo **ViteJS + Svelte**;
- Changes are _almost instantly_ reflected on the browser after saving, which is a huge improvement over developing in frameworks such as Next.js or Gatsby;
- Components are overall easier to write in Svelte, with a lot less boilerplate code when comparing to React. Felt a lot more closely related to HTML & CSS!

Looking forward to see where Svelte is heading in the future! ðŸ‘€
